# Maze-Solver

Simple Java and C implementation of a Maze Solver.

The java version can recieve a maze either throught direct input or .txt file and has a graphical output.
The C version can recive only direct user input and prints the solved maze to the console.

The maze doesnt need to have an outside layer of walls and the char '.' will be used to mark a free spot,
any other char will be considered a wall.
